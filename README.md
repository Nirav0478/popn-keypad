# Pop'n Keypad
This is an unfinished macropad I am working on for the rhythm game Pop'n Music. I am currently designing its PCB. 

## Goals
Create a working keypad for Pop'n Music
- Bottom row has 5 keys, top row has 4 keys
- Keycaps need to be color coded according to its controller
- I should be able to play on it reasonably well
- Hot swappable keyswitches
- Vertically as short as possible

## Supplies
- Arduino Micro
- Custom PCB
- Colored keycaps
- Hot swap plugs
- Keyswitches (clicky)
- 3d printed case

## My Design process
1. Made some simple paper sketches of what exactly I am looking for.
2. I watched various tutorials on YouTube.
3. Designed a PCB on Kicad
