# Pop'n Keypad
This is an unfinished macropad I am working on for the rhythm game Pop'n Music. I am currently designing its PCB. 

## The Problem
To keep it short, because the keys on my laptop tend to ghost their inputs when I press multiple keys at a time, I need to have a dedicated controller to play Pop'n Music. Buying a full controller and making one yourself are both ridiculously expensive, so I instead sought to make a miniature macropad with a very similar layout!

## Goals
Create a working keypad for Pop'n Music
- Bottom row has 5 keys, top row has 4 keys
- Keycaps need to be color coded according to its controller
- I should be able to play on it reasonably well
- Hot swappable keyswitches
- Vertically as short as possible

## Supplies
- Arduino Micro
- Custom PCB
- Colored keycaps
- Hot swap plugs
- Keyswitches (clicky)
- 3d printed case

## My Design process
1. Made some simple paper sketches of what exactly I am looking for.
2. I watched various tutorials on YouTube about using KiCad to make keyboard PCBs.
3. Prototyped a rudimentary outline on TinkerCad.
4. Designed a PCB on Kicad
